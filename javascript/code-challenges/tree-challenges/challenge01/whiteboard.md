### Problem Domain:

There are hireachical relations between the values that you have in your idea before coding, such as a file management system.


### Algorithm:

1. Create a Binary Tree class that has the methods, preOrder, inOrder, and postOrder.

2. Pre-order order should be:
 Root >> Left >> Right.

3. In-order order should be:
Left >> Root >> Right.

4. Post-Order order should be:
Left >> Right >> Root.

5. Using left, right, and root variables we can set the order of each method.

### Edge Case:

When the tree is empty.
